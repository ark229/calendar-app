# Calendar Application | Final Project

## Documentation

The calendar app was created with Ionic v3 and Cordova

<p>The calendar is fully displayed on the screen, and users can view different months with their corresponding years by clicking the foward/backward arrow keys.</p>

<p>The app has an event modal button. When clicked the user can add an event to the calendar as shown in the picture below. </p>

<p>Once the user has typed all of their information they can save the event. The event will appear in the whitespace under the calendar. A user also has the ability to click on the event and edit it's contents. </p>

## Issues

<p>I was only able to present and screencast the basic features of the application. The full features of this app cannot be tested within the browser, since cordova cannot run on the browser. This issue is shown during my demonstration when the cordova error appeared. I ended up facing several issues when trying to run the app with the android emulator to fully test it for the demonstartion. To utlize Ionic v3 for the class I had to use a linux virtual machine. The virtual machine did not have enough space to run Android Studio's emulator properly. When I tried to do it on my local machine by cloning the repo and running the application from there, I encountered a lot of problems.</p>
